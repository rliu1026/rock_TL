# rock_TL
A transfer learning project that classifies rock images into different 10 classes. 
The project integrates the award-wining ResNet50 and ResNet152 with task-specific classification layer for rock image classification. 

Data used:
More than 1500 rock pictures have been collected from online databases and RockD uploads. Sources listed below:
  1.	Field pictures taken by phd Shan Ye (https://github.com/yeshancqcq) and other professional colleagues
  2.	Some pictures uploaded by Rockd App users
  3.	Online rock image collections from universities:
    a)	University of Pittsburgh, http://www.pitt.edu/~cejones/GeoImages/index.html
    b)	University of Kentucky, https://kgs.uky.edu/kgsweb/geology/image_search.asp
    c)	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, https://geosci.unc.edu/people/allen-f-glazner/glazner-research/photos/geology-image-gallery/
    d)	China University of Geosciences Beijing, http://www.nimrf.cugb.edu.cn/ept/list

The 10 class labels are: 
    'carbonate_fossil', 
    'carbonate_stalagmite',
    'carbonate_travertin',
    'igneous_basaltcolumn',
    'igneous_pahoehoe',
    'igneous_phanerocrystal',
    'malachite',
    'marble',
    'sandstone', 
    'shale'.
